## SupersoniQ: A Lightweight Message Broker Built in Go

**SupersoniQ** is an open-source message broker project that aims to provide a lightweight and efficient messaging solution written entirely in Go. Inspired by the features and capabilities of RabbitMQ, SupersoniQ leverages the AMQP protocol for interoperability while focusing on simplicity and performance.

### Why SupersoniQ?

* **Lightweight and Fast**: Built with Go's concurrency model and efficient data structures, SupersoniQ is designed to handle messaging tasks with minimal overhead.
* **Easy to Use**: A straightforward API makes it simple to integrate SupersoniQ into your applications, whether you're building microservices, handling event-driven architectures, or processing real-time data.
* **AMQP Compliant**: By adhering to the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol, SupersoniQ ensures compatibility with various clients and tools within the AMQP ecosystem.
* **Dockerized Deployment**: SupersoniQ is designed for easy deployment using Docker, facilitating local development, testing, and deployment to various environments.

### Key Features

* **Core Messaging**: Supports basic AMQP operations such as publishing messages to queues, consuming messages, and acknowledging message delivery.
* **Queue Management**: Allows for the creation and deletion of queues to organize and manage message flow.
* **Message Persistence**: Offers options for persisting messages to disk to ensure durability and prevent message loss.
* **Concurrency**: Leverages Go's goroutines and channels to handle multiple connections and operations concurrently.
* **Extensible Design**:  Provides a foundation for future features like message routing with exchanges, dead-letter queues, and advanced AMQP functionalities.
