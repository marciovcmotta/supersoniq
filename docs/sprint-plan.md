### Sprint 1: Project Setup and Core Structure (1 week)

* **Goal:** Set up the development environment, establish the basic project structure, and implement fundamental components like logging and configuration.

* **Tasks:**
    * Set up Go development environment and install necessary dependencies.
    * Initialize the project repository on GitHub and configure CI/CD (if desired).
    * Create the basic project structure with appropriate directories (e.g., `cmd`, `pkg`, `internal`).
    * Choose a logging library and integrate it into the project.
    * Implement basic configuration handling (e.g., reading from environment variables or files).
    * Implement a basic TCP server for handling incoming connections.
    * Implement a simple "ping/pong" mechanism over TCP to test basic communication.
    * Write unit tests for the TCP server and communication logic.
    * Begin drafting initial documentation in the README.

### Sprint 2: AMQP Connection and Queue Basics (2 weeks)

* **Goal:** Implement AMQP connection handling, basic frame parsing, and fundamental queue operations.
    * Implement AMQP connection establishment and heartbeat mechanism.
    * Implement basic frame parsing for AMQP methods (e.g., connection.start, connection.tune).
    * Implement queue creation and deletion.
    * Write unit tests for connection and queue functionalities.
    * Create a basic Dockerfile for SupersoniQ.
---
### Sprint 3:  Publish/Subscribe and Basic QoS (2 weeks)

* **Goal:**  Enable core messaging functionality with basic publishing, consuming, and QoS capabilities.
    * Implement basic message publishing with routing key and content type.
    * Implement basic message consumption with acknowledgment.
    * Implement basic QoS (prefetch count) for consumers.
    * Write unit tests for publishing and consuming.
    * Write integration tests for basic message flow.
    * Update README with basic connection and publishing/consuming examples.
---
### Sprint 4: Refinement, Persistence, and Docker Compose (2 weeks)

* **Goal:**  Enhance message handling, introduce message persistence, and improve stability.
    * Implement message acknowledgment with different modes (e.g., ack, nack, reject).
    * Introduce a simple persistence mechanism (e.g., file-based storage) for messages.
    * Implement error handling and logging for improved debugging.
    * Refactor code for better organization and maintainability.
    * Conduct thorough testing (unit and integration) for persistence and error handling.
    * Create a docker-compose file for local testing with a sample client.
---
### Sprint 5:  Advanced Features and Polish (2 weeks)

* **Goal:** Add more advanced AMQP features and prepare for potential deployment options.
    * Implement exchange support (e.g., direct, fanout) for message routing.
    * Implement dead-letter queues for handling unroutable messages.
    * Add support for message properties (e.g., headers, delivery mode).
    * Optimize performance for message handling and throughput.
    * Refine Docker configuration for potential deployment scenarios (e.g., adding environment variables).
    * Update documentation with advanced usage examples and deployment instructions.
---
### Future Sprints (Beyond MVP):

* Explore clustering and high availability for production deployments.
* Implement user authentication and authorization.
* Add management interface (e.g., HTTP API, CLI) for monitoring and administration.
* Develop client libraries in different languages (e.g., Python, Java) for easier integration.


This updated plan incorporates your feedback and emphasizes a more gradual progression of complexity, starting with essential setup and gradually building towards a functional MVP. I hope this helps!
