### Sprint 1: Project Setup and Core Structure (1 week)

* **Goal:** Set up the development environment, establish the basic project structure, and implement fundamental components like logging and configuration.

* **Tasks:**
    * Set up Node.js and npm development environment.
    * Initialize the project repository on GitHub and configure CI/CD (if desired).
    * Create the basic project structure with appropriate directories (e.g., `src`, `test`).
    * Choose a logging library (e.g., Winston) and integrate it into the project.
    * Implement basic configuration handling (e.g., using environment variables or a configuration file).
    * Set up a basic web server using Express.js.
    * Create a simple "hello world" endpoint to test the server.
    * Write unit tests for basic server functionality.
    * Begin drafting initial documentation in the README.

### Sprint 2: WebSocket Integration and AMQP Connection (2 weeks)

* **Goal:** Integrate WebSockets for real-time communication and establish a connection with the AMQP broker.

* **Tasks:**
    * Choose a WebSocket library (e.g., `ws`) and integrate it with the server.
    * Implement WebSocket handshake and basic message handling.
    * Choose an AMQP client library (e.g., `amqplib`) and establish a connection to a RabbitMQ server.
    * Implement basic AMQP operations (e.g., connect, disconnect).
    * Write unit tests for WebSocket and AMQP connection functionalities.

### Sprint 3:  Publish/Subscribe and Basic Queue Operations (2 weeks)

* **Goal:**  Enable core messaging functionality with basic publishing, consuming, and queue management.

* **Tasks:**
    * Implement message publishing to queues via WebSockets and AMQP.
    * Implement message consumption from queues via WebSockets and AMQP.
    * Implement basic queue operations (create, delete, list).
    * Write unit and integration tests for publishing and consuming messages.
    * Update README with basic connection, publishing, and consuming examples.

### Sprint 4:  Message Acknowledgment and Persistence (2 weeks)

* **Goal:**  Enhance message handling with acknowledgment and introduce message persistence.

* **Tasks:**
    * Implement message acknowledgment mechanisms (ack, nack, reject).
    * Introduce a simple persistence mechanism (e.g., file-based or using a database like MongoDB) for messages.
    * Implement error handling and logging for improved debugging.
    * Refactor code for better organization and maintainability.
    * Conduct thorough testing (unit and integration) for persistence and error handling.

---
### Sprint 5:  Advanced Features and Polish (2 weeks)

* **Goal:** Add more advanced AMQP features and refine the application for deployment.

* **Tasks:**
    * Implement exchange support (e.g., direct, fanout) for message routing.
    * Implement dead-letter queues for handling unroutable messages.
    * Add support for message properties (e.g., headers, delivery mode).
    * Optimize performance for message handling and throughput.
    * Create a Dockerfile for containerization and deployment.
    * Update documentation with advanced usage examples and deployment instructions.

---
### Future Sprints (Beyond MVP):

* Explore clustering and high availability for production deployments.
* Implement user authentication and authorization.
* Add a management interface (e.g., a web UI or CLI) for monitoring and administration.
* Develop client libraries in various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java) for easier integration.
